# YANHOS
YANHOS (Yet Another Non-Heuristic Operating System) is an educational OS designed to teach and explore fundamental operating system concepts without relying on heuristic approximations. Inspired by NACHOS but with a renewed focus, YANHOS aims to be an accessible and easily identifiable tool for computer science students and enthusiasts.
